<p>The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, 
and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa 
as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that 
the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and 
has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>

<p>The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept 
as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. They are 
often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat 
breeds recognized by various cat registries.</p>
