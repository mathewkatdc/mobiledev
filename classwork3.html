	<p>The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, 
	and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa 
	as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that 
	the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and 
	has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>

	<p>The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept 
	as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. They are 
	often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat 
	breeds recognized by various cat registries.</p>

	<p>Pogona is a genus of reptiles containing nine lizard species which are often known by the common name bearded 
	dragons. The name "bearded dragon" refers to the "beard" of the dragon, the underside of the throat which turns 
	black if they are stressed or see a potential rival. They are adept climbers, spending time onbranches and in 
	bushes and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. 
	They are found throughout much of Australia in a wide range of habitats such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus 
	woodlands.</p>

<p>The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. It is one 
of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the 
Prussian carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is native to East Asia. It was first selectively bred in Ancient 
China more than a thousand years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary 
greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration and colouration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, 
brown, and black are known).</p>
